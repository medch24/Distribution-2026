# Distribution-2026 - Fixes Applied (2025-10-31)

## ✅ Issue 1: Academic Calendar Update
**Problem:** Calendar needed to be updated from 2025-2026 with user-provided TSV data (231 entries).
**Critical Error:** November was incorrectly showing "Vacance" entries.

**Solution:**
- Replaced entire `academicCalendar` array in `public/index.html` (lines 94-324)
- Used exact TSV data provided by user
- November (weeks 10-14) now correctly shows type: 'Cours' for all days
- Date range: 31/08/2025 to 18/06/2026

**Verification:**
```bash
grep -o "02/11/2025.*Cours" public/index.html
grep -o "27/11/2025.*Cours" public/index.html
```

## ✅ Issue 2: Session Counting Logic
**Problem:** Special days (Saudi National day, evaluation, examen, Saudi Foundation Day) were NOT reducing the number of regular course sessions available in that week.

**Example:**
- Before: Week with 6 sessions/week + 1 Saudi National day = 6 regular sessions (WRONG)
- After: Week with 6 sessions/week + 1 Saudi National day = 5 regular sessions (CORRECT)

**Solution:**
Modified session counting logic in `public/index.html` (lines 501-513):

```javascript
// Before:
weekMaxSessions[weekValue] = baseSessionsPerWeek;

// After:
const specialDaysCount = jsonData.slice(1).filter((r, i) => {
    const e = academicCalendar[i];
    return e && e.week === weekValue && !isPlannable(e) && isSpecialDay(e);
}).length;

weekMaxSessions[weekValue] = Math.max(1, baseSessionsPerWeek - specialDaysCount);
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `isPlannable(event)`: Returns true only for type === 'Cours'
- `isSpecialDay(event)`: Detects special days that count as sessions
- Special days REDUCE available regular sessions: `baseSessionsPerWeek - specialDaysCount`
- Minimum of 1 session per week maintained with `Math.max(1, ...)`

## ✅ Issue 3: Word Document Generation (Empty Documents)
**Problem:** `generateWord()` function produced empty Word documents.

**Root Cause Identified:**
The template (`Repartition_du_programme_2026.docx`) uses **calendar-based week numbers**:
- Template tags: `{#week2_seances}`, `{#week4_seances}`, `{#week7_seances}`, `{#week23_seances}`, etc.

But the JavaScript code was generating **sequential week numbers**:
- Old data keys: `week1_seances`, `week2_seances`, `week3_seances` (1st, 2nd, 3rd week in month)

**Mismatch Example:**
- September Week 1 = "Semaine 2" in calendar
  - Old code: Generated `week1_seances` ❌
  - Template: Expected `week2_seances` ✅

**Solution:**
Completely rewrote `prepareWordDataForSubject()` function in `public/index.html` (lines 793-927):

### Key Changes:
1. **Extract Week Numbers from Calendar:**
   ```javascript
   function getWeekNumber(weekString) {
       const match = weekString.match(/Semaine (\d+)/);
       return match ? parseInt(match[1], 10) : null;
   }
   ```

2. **Use Calendar Week Numbers as Keys:**
   ```javascript
   // Old approach:
   const weeksInMonth = Object.values(monthData.weeks);
   for (let i = 0; i < weeksInMonth.length; i++) {
       monthRow[`week${i + 1}_seances`] = [...]; // Sequential: week1, week2, week3
   }
   
   // New approach:
   const weekNum = getWeekNumber(event.week); // Extract: "Semaine 2" -> 2
   templateData[`week${weekNum}_seances`] = [...]; // Calendar-based: week2, week4, week7
   ```

3. **Flat Data Structure:**
   - Old: Nested months → weeks structure
   - New: Flat structure with week-specific keys matching template exactly

4. **Direct Mapping:**
   - "Semaine 2" → `week2_seances`
   - "Semaine 4" → `week4_seances`
   - "Semaine 23" → `week23_seances`

### Template Structure (from user):
```
{#week2_seances}
Séance {seance_num}:  
{chapitre} 
{contenu_lecon} 
Support : {res_lecon} 
Devoirs : {devoir} : {res_devoir}
Recherche/Projet : {recherche}
{projet}
{/week2_seances}
```

### Data Fields Generated:
- `seance_num`: Session number within week
- `chapitre`: Chapter/topic
- `contenu_lecon`: Lesson content
- `res_lecon`: Lesson resources
- `devoir`: Homework
- `res_devoir`: Homework resources
- `recherche`: Research work
- `projet`: Project work

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Calendar Verification:
- Load application
- Check that November shows regular "Cours" days (no vacations)
- Verify date range: 31/08/2025 to 18/06/2026

### 2. Session Counting Test:
- Create distribution for a subject with 6 sessions/week
- Find a week with 1 special day (e.g., Saudi National day)
- Verify only 5 regular course sessions are distributed in that week

### 3. Word Generation Test:
- Select a class and subject
- Click "Générer Word"
- Verify document contains:
  - Class name and subject name
  - Week names (Semaine 2, Semaine 4, etc.)
  - Session details for each week
  - Content is NOT empty

All changes committed and pushed to `medch24/Distribution-2026` repository:

1. **abdfc21** - "fix: Correct Word generation data structure to match template week numbers"
2. **14bdc1e** - "feat: Update academic calendar 2025-2026 and fix session counting logic"

## Files Modified

- **public/index.html**
  - Lines 94-324: Academic calendar data (231 entries)
  - Lines 501-513: Session counting logic with special day reduction
  - Lines 793-927: Complete rewrite of `prepareWordDataForSubject()` function

---

## Technical Details

### Session Distribution Algorithm:
1. Calculate base sessions per week from `classSessionCounts`
2. Count special days in each week that are NOT plannable but ARE special
3. Subtract special days from base: `weekMaxSessions = baseSessionsPerWeek - specialDaysCount`
4. Distribute remaining sessions evenly across plannable days
5. Respect minimum of 1 session per week

### Word Template Compatibility:
- Template uses docxtemplater library with PizZip
- Loop syntax: `{#variable}...{/variable}`
- Simple tags: `{variable}`
- Weeks are referenced by calendar numbers (2, 4, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22-31, etc.)
- Data must provide exact matching keys: `week2_seances`, `week4_seances`, etc.

## Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

1. ✅ Academic calendar updated with correct 2025-2026 dates
2. ✅ Session counting logic fixed (special days reduce available sessions)
3. ✅ Word generation fixed (data structure matches template expectations)
4. ✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub

Ready for testing and deployment.
